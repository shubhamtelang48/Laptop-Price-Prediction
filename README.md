# Problem Statement for Laptop Price Prediction

We will make a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop then our model should be compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations. Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest in developing this project.

# Basic Understanding of Laptop Price Prediction Data

The first step is to import the libraries and load data. After that we will take a basic understanding of data like its shape, sample, is there are any NULL values present in the dataset. Understanding the data is an important step for prediction or any machine learning project.
- After the loading of data we have do following steps
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Machine learning Modeling
